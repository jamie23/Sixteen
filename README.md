# Sixteen

Sixteen is a Hacker News client built for Android.

It uses the awesome Hex API built by [Sean Powell](https://github.com/longdivision).

You can download it from the Play Store ~~[here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jamie.hn).~~

> _**Warning**_

_The API is currently down so I've removed the app from the store, I've added a commit to load dummy data from a local source if you wish to run the app anyway._

## Aims

The main aim was to build out a Hacker News client that I enjoyed using, relying on modern Android technologies, so there is heavy influence from two apps I love, [Boost For Reddit](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rubenmayayo.reddit&hl=en_GB&gl=US) and [Hex for Hacker News](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hexforhn.hex&hl=en_GB&gl=US).
